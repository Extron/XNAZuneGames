# XNA Games for Zune
_For archival purposes_

This is a monolithic repository for all of the [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) [Zune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune) games I developed in the past when I was first learning to program. Currently, these projects are effectively not buildable as they only work within Microsoft's XNA framework, which is no longer being distributed, and as the Zune is a discontinued device, there isn't much applicability for them anyway. I may eventually attempt to rebuild them using [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/), an open-source version of the XNA framework.

Within these repositories are the source for four games and their supporting libraries: [Quatrix](https://github.com/Extron/XNAZuneGames/tree/master/Quatrix/Quatrix) (a Tetris clone), Snakez(https://github.com/Extron/XNAZuneGames/tree/master/Snake/Snakez) (A Snake clone), [Quatrix HD](https://github.com/Extron/XNAZuneGames/tree/master/Quatrix%20HD/QuatrixHD) (A Zune HD version of Quatrix), and [Combat Effective](https://github.com/Extron/XNAZuneGames/tree/master/Combat%20Effective/CombatEffective) (a top down shooter). Most of these games were unfinished.
